### Hello World!
----

I'm a full stack developer. I recently graduated from Northcoders' bootcamp and I and spending some time reviewing and improving on what I have learnt, and looking for a job! 

I hereby invite you to have a browse of some of my work! I'll warn you though, some of these repos are from sprints on the course that did not get completed. 

I am currently job searching, so if what you see here impresses you, please get in touch! My email is belladevelops@gmail.com
